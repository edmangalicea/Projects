The program implements two tree traversal algorithm, Greedy Best First Search and A Star search.

There are two csv files. Straight line distance and driving distance. The algorithms use those files to find the closest path between two states.

The program is run in the terminal like so "python3 cs480_P01_A20418990.py INITIAL_STATE GOAL_STATE"

A detailed output is then printed to screen.
